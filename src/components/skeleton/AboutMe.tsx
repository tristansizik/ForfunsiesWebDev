                  I&apos;m a multifaceted artist and innovator from San Diego with a gift for adapting to whatever needs to be done.<br/><br/>
I have a burning love for learning, which motivates me to push past fear in pursuit of my goals. I&apos;m skilled at problem-solving and passionate about creating meaningful human connectionsâ€”I truly believe that community can accelerate any passion or dream.<br/><br/>
This love for learning has inspired me to take on the traits of a jack-of-all-trades. I earned a degree in Computer Engineering from San Diego State University, and my journey has led me to develop skills as a Software Engineer, Photographer, Graphic Designer, Web Developer, Business Marketer, Music Producer, and DJ.<br/><br/>
When I&apos;m not tinkering at my desk, you&apos;ll find me training for a half marathon, surfing, snowboarding, or thrifting to express myself through fashion.<br/><br/>

              Howdy! Thanks for checking out my page. I&apos;m a software dev that loves to touch grass. Amongst my personal projects of learning front end development,
              I take quests to camp with friends, am currently interested in traveling East in North America, and I love to snowboard (currently a Ikon Pass Holder).
              I really want to get involved in some cool open source projects, so please contact me if you&apos;d like someone with the following skillsets...
